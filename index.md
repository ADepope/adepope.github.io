Hi, I am a PhD student at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) co-affiliated with [Medical Genomics group](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/robinson-group/) led by Prof. Matthew Robinson and [Data Science, Machine Learning, and Information Theory group](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/mondelli-group/) led by Prof. [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/index.html).


Prior to my current studies, I obtained a Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Master in Mathematical statistics from University of Zagreb, [Department of Mathematics](https://www.pmf.unizg.hr/math/en).

I am a PhD student at IST Austria working in the intersection between mathematically grounded ML, numerical mathematics, software development and genetics applications.

My hobbies include hiking and running, also when I have time I try to volunteer by preparing and giving lectures in competitive mathematics to gifted students from my old high-school and at MNM summer
camps.
