Hi, I am a PhD student at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) co-affiliated with [Medical Genomics group](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/robinson-group/) led by Prof. Matthew Robinson and [Data Science, Machine Learning, and Information Theory group](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/mondelli-group/) led by Prof. [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/index.html).

Prior to my current studies, I obtained a Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Master in Mathematical statistics from University of Zagreb, [Department of Mathematics](https://www.pmf.unizg.hr/math/en).
